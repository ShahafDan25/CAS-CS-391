    "When first presented with the Monty Hall problem, an overwhelming majority of people assume that each door has an equal probability and conclude that switching does not matter.[9] Out of 228 subjects in one study, only 13% chose to switch.[20] In her book The Power of Logical Thinking,[21] quotes cognitive psychologist Massimo Piattelli Palmarini [it]: \"No other statistical puzzle comes so close to fooling all the people all the time [and] even Nobel physicists systematically give the wrong answer, and that they insist on it, and they are ready to berate in print those who propose the right answer.\" Pigeons repeatedly exposed to the problem show that they rapidly learn to always switch, unlike humans.[22]\n",
