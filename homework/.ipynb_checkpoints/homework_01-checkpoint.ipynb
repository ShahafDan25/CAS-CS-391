    "Akhil is a youth activist, who is going door-to-door in his neighborhood to hand out material on upcoming events around town. He only hands out flyers to households where the door is answered *and* a teenager lives there. He finds that the probability of each door being answered is $p_1$, and the probability of a teenager living at an address is $p_2$. You may assume that residents answer doors independently of the presence of teenagers. Work out the probability of the folloing events. (We may assume that the number of calls is always sufficiently large to hand out the desired number of flyers.)\n",
