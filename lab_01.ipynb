So, before you convert to a PDF, **make sure to run all of your code cells, and that they are showing the output you expect them to.**  The graders can only read your code in the PDF, they cannot run it, so they will base much of their grade on the output shown in your Jupyter notebook.  **If you forget to run a code cell, and therefore you don't show any output, you may loose points even if your code is correct.**\n",

Since it takes significantly longer to grade homework that is not properly matched, **we may deduct points** for noncompliant submissions."
